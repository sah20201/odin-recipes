    <h1>Piri Piri Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../images/chix.jpg"

            <p><h3>Piri-piri chicken is a spicy dish with roots in 
                both Africa and Portugal.
                The dish was created in Angola and Mozambique when Portuguese settlers 
                arrived with chile peppers (known as piri-piri in Swahili).</h3></p>

                <p>This Piri Piri Chicken recipe is an at home version of the dish you’ll find at any Nando’s location! If you aren’t familiar with Nando’s they’re an international chain of restaurants that specialize in Portuguese cuisine. Their signature dish is this Portuguese Piri Piri chicken.</p>

                    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>10 African bird's eye chile peppers</li>
                            <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>
                            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                            <li>2 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
                            <li>2 limes, juiced</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
                            <li>1 chicken breast, cut in half </li>
                            <li>2 chicken leg quarters with skin</li>

                        </ul>

                            <p><h2>Directions</h2></p>
                                <ol>
                                        <li><p>Use rubber gloves to mince the chiles and place into a mixing bowl. Add cilantro, garlic, vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix piri piri sauce well.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Place chicken breasts and legs into a resealable plastic bag. Pour in piri piri sauce, seal the bag, and shake gently to completely cover chicken. Put the bag in the refrigerator to marinate at least 4 hours.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Remove bag from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to allow chicken to come to room temperature.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Remove chicken from the bag; discard bag and cilantro. Cook chicken on the preheated grill, rotating as necessary to cook evenly, until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 minutes.</p></li>

                                </ol>
                                <p><h2>Serving Suggestions</h2></p>
                                    <p>I like to serve Piri Piri chicken over a hearty grain, like farro or quinoa and topped with extra Piri Piri sauce. On the side, a cool salad or lightly steamed or grilled veggie works great.</p>
                                    <p><h2>ENJOY!!!</h2></p>
